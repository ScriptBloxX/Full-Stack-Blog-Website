<hr>

This is my first website with a backend. I've never learned anything like this before. because the teacher did not teach So I practiced all by myself. May not be universally correct or the code may be difficult to read You can blame and advise. I will continue to improve. 

It took me a very long time to develop this website. So when you clone it please don't forget me.

Thank you! ‚úåÔ∏è
